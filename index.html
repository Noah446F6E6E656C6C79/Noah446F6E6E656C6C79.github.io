	<h1> About Noah Donnelly </h1>

	<p> Hello I am Noah Donnelly and I am a student of computer science at Towson University. I have a dog and two cats. My dog once got hit by a car because he tried to attack it, but came away unscathed.
		I really prefer C and systems programming but web development is also fun. Since I am a beginner this page is bland right now, but as time goes on it will become more elaborate.
		I play video games, I am currently playing Factorio and Bannerlord, but I tend to shift games frequently. I also do interdisciplinary research combining ethics and computer science.
